libmikmod for Playstation Portable:

The PSP driver was written by sweetlilmre <sweetlilmre@gmail.com>  for
libmikmod-3.1.11 based on the one from Jim Shaw's original mikmod-3.0.3
port, with code borrowed from pspaudiolib. The driver and the Makefiles
and the example code here are adapted from the ps2dev.org svn versions.


BUILDING libmikmod for PSP:

You need pspsdk installed, and psp-config must be on your $PATH.
See http://sourceforge.net/projects/minpspw/
as well as http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/ for toolchains.
Run 'make -f Makefile.psp' to build the library.


NOTE taken from original README.PSP:

Be aware: if you are calling MikMod_Update() from another thread on the
PSP, you MUST yeild after the call to MikMod_Update():
  sceKernelDelayThread(1);
will be sufficient.  From what I understand, the PSP uses co-operative
multitasking and as the MikMod_Update() call effectively becomes a busy
wait loop after MikMod_DisableOutput() is called, your main thread will
be starved if you don't do this. example.c contains the code for this:
PSP example code was originally written by Nevyn, further changed and
updated by sweetlilmre. To compile it, run: 'make -f Makefile.example'
