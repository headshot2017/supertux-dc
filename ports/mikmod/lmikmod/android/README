- libmikmod for Android:

Building: To compile the Android version, the Android NDK must be
installed on your machine. If so, type the 'ndk-build' command in
command line. The compiled shared Android libraries for ARM and
ARMv7-A architectures are placed to the generated libs directory.
If necessary, edit config.h and jni/Android.mk to modify compiler
flags and customize the build.

The compiled libraries do not provide a JNI interface for Java
applications, because the primary intention is (just) to use
the libmikmod in native code as a shared library.
For the JNI wrapper see the old libmikmod-android project:
http://github.com/0xD34D/libmikmod-android

The aforementioned project was also the source of the used
OpenSL ES driver modified for recent versions of libmikmod.
