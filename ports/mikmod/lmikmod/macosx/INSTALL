>> BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR libmikmod FOR MAC OS X
------------------------------------------------

You can always use the UNIX commandline tools
instead of the IDE projects in this directory.

Go to the top level and follow the INSTALL there...
(Hint: "./configure && make && sudo make install")

In that case your files will end up under /usr/local.
The IDE stuff will end up under a "build" directory.

You can also play with the standalone Makefile.darwin
file here in this directory, in order to build from
the command line. (Hint: "gmake -f Makefile.darwin" )


XCode on Mac OS X 10.3 and newer:
-------------

1) You should be using Xcode 2.x, or up.

2) Open "libmikmod.xcodeproj" with the Xcode app.


Build products
--------------

The projects will build a static library with header:
- mikmod.h
- libmikmod.a
And they will also build a dynamic framework bundle:
- mikmod.framework

These build products are normally found in the "build"
folder, unless you have changed your IDE settings...


Using the library
----------------

To use the library, either copy "mikmod.framework"
bundle to somewhere in your framework search path,
(such as ~/Library/Frameworks or /Library/Frameworks)

Source code:	#include <mikmod/mikmod.h>

Linker flags:	-framework mikmod


Or copy the "mikmod.h" header and "libmikmod.a" library
to somewhere in the include and library search paths.
(such as /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib)

Source code:	#include "mikmod.h"

Linker flags:	-lmikmod -framework CoreAudio


The HTML documentation is found in the "docs" folder,
located in the top level of the libmikmod distribution.



Enjoy!
