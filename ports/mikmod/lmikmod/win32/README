  Hello folks !


This is libmikmod, version 3.3.11, a portable sound library for Unix.
Check out the file 'NEWS' for more history information.


>> BUILDING LIBMIKMOD
---------------------

- If you're not building libmikmod for Windows, then you're lost in the
  sources. Go up one directory, and read the main README file.

So, you're on an angry fruit salad Windows system, aren't you ? With
those so cute icons and an overflowed system tray ?

Currently, libmikmod can be build under Windows with the Microsoft
compiler, lcc-win32 and MinGW (I suppose that the Watcom compiler and Metrowerks
Codewarrior could be used as well).

You'll need the DirectX SDK (if not included with the compiler) to
compile the DirectSound driver; version 5 or better is required. The
standard Win32 SDK is enough for the winmm driver.

Oh, I almost forgot: you need long filenames to compile libmikmod, but
that should not be a problem nowadays.


-- Instructions for Microsoft Compiler

Use one of the project files to build a dll and an import library: MSVC6
for the old Visual C 6, or VS2005 for Visual Studio 2005 and newer.
To make your library ready to use, copy the file 'mikmod.h' to your
compiler include directory, and 'mikmod.lib` to your compiler libraries
directory. You also have to put 'libmikmod.dll' somewhere in your PATH.

HTML documentation of the library, for programmers, is located in the
doc directory.

-- Instructions for lcc-win32

Use Makefile.lcc

-- Instructions for MingGW

Use Makefile.mingw

>> THANKS
---------

I would like to thank everyone who contributed to libmikmod. Their names
are in the AUTHORS file for the significative contributions, but some
other names can be found in the NEWS file. Thanks a lot ! Keeping
libmikmod alive wouldn't be much fun without you.
