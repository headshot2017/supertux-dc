REQUIREMENTS
------------

  CONTROLS
  --------
    The game can be played with either a the keyboard or a joystick.

  SDL
  ---
    "SuperTux" was programed using the "Simple DirectMedia Layer"
    libraries by Sam Lantinga.  This means that the game can
    theoretically run under any environment that the SDL libraries support.

    (As of this program's release, this includes: Linux X11/DGA,
    Win32 WinDIB/DirectX, BeOS BWindow, and Solaris X11, as well
    as unofficually supported: Linux SVGAlib, IRIX 6.x X11,
    FreeBSD 3.x X11, and MacOS.)

    The Simple DirectMedia Layer is required to compile this game.

    You can download the SDL libraries from:
      http://www.libsdl.org/

  SDL_image
  ---------
    SDL_image is also required.  (It is used to load the PNG format images
    that come with SuperTux!)

  SDL_mixer
  ---------
    Sound and music are available, but are not required (see below).
    You will need the "SDL_mixer" library compiled and installed if
    you want sound.

  OpenGL implementation (optional)
  ---------------------
    Mesa should be installed in order to compile, but it is painly
    slow when running, so we advise you to install your videocard
    drivers (of course, it has to be an accelerated videocard).
    For linux, nvidia vendor is the only one that makes decent drivers.
    But the ATI drivers should run with the same performance, since
    it only uses accelerated 2d, not 3d.

    Anyway, you can use the SDL frontend and you most likely won't
    notice any difference.


INSTALLING UNDER LINUX/UNIX
---------------------------
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Note: Read this entire section before you start issuing commands!
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  SuperTux uses a script that checks for dependency and disables
  features, in case they are not found.
  The script is the configure and you can specify a few stuff
  like the directory to which you want to install SuperTux,
  by giving the argument --prefix=/usr/local (ie). For more
  informations, type './configure --help'.
  (Note: SuperTux does not need to be installed in the system,
  you can run it from its own directory.)

  If there isn't any configure script (ie. in case, you got it
  via cvs), just run the autogen.sh script.

  To compile it, a 'make' is enough.
  Type 'make install' (as root) to copy it into the system.
  (default directory is /usr/local, see above how to change
  this.)

  So, in short, just type:
  sh autogen.sh (in case there isn't any configure file already)
  sh configure
  make

  And in case you want to copy SuperTux to the system:
  make install (as root)


ICON FILE
---------
  A 32x32, XPM-format icon file is available if you wish to use
  an icon for a menu entry for this game.

  The file is "icon.xpm", and can be found at  the data/images/
  directory.
